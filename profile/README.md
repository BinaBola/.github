Theme             : Health Innovation: Empowering Vulnerable Communities for Health and Well-being

The quality of local Indonesian football players needs to be improved to compete with naturalized players and other top global players. Many talented young Indonesian football players do not reach their full potential. This is due to a number of factors, including a lack of access to quality training and coaching, as well as an unhealthy lifestyle.

One way to address this problem is to improve the football development program at the youth level. This can be done through a personalized training program for players and their healthy lifestyle. This application can help improve the quality of Indonesian football players by providing them with personalized training and feedback. The application can also help prevent injuries by teaching players how to perform exercises correctly. The application can be used by football players of all ages and skill levels.

We are seeking funding to develop and launch this application. We believe that this application has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of Indonesian football players.

This application can be a valuable tool for football players of all ages and skill levels. It can help them improve their technique, prevent injuries, and reach their full potential. We are committed to making this application affordable and accessible to all Indonesian football players.
