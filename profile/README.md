Theme             : Health Innovation: Empowering Vulnerable Communities for Health and Well-being

The quality of local Indonesian football players needs to be improved to compete with naturalized players and other top global players. Many talented young Indonesian football players do not reach their full potential. This is due to a number of factors, including a lack of access to quality personalized physical training, as well as an unhealthy lifestyle.

One way to address this problem is to improve the football development program at the youth level. This can be done through a personalized training program for players and their healthy lifestyle. This application can help improve the quality of Indonesian football players by providing them with personalized physical training and feedback that also help prevent injuries by teaching players on how to perform exercises correctly. Last, the application can also guide the players in healthy consumptions, which is very crucial for young talents.

We are seeking funding to develop and launch this application. We believe that this application has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of Indonesian football players. This application will be a valuable tool for young football talents. It can help them improve their health, physicality, prevent injuries, and reach their full potential. We are committed to making this application affordable and accessible to all young Indonesian football players.
